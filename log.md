# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 4, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: Checked out some API's where I could get course data from UTM without having to implement my own using a web scraper

**Thoughts:** Looks like VIAplanners API is upto date and is the most verbose option I've seen so far. However, it looks like the API key is only available to primary developers. I also came across an outdated but more open API called Nickel. I'm not sure if Nickel still works but it looks like its available to use currently. It was last updated last year.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
